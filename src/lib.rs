/*
This crate is meant to be a direct C-to-Rust translation of the algorithms in the popular dump1090 program.
It was developed by referencing the version found at https://github.com/adsbxchange/dump1090-mutability
It matches bit-for-bit in almost every case, but there may be some edge cases where handling of rounding, non-deterministic
timing, and things like that might give results that are not quite identical.
